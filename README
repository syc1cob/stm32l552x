The STM32L552x series (part of the STM32L5 family from STMicroelectronics) is based on the Arm® Cortex®-M33 core with TrustZone® technology. Here's a general overview of its memory regions. Specific sizes and addresses may vary slightly depending on the exact variant (e.g., STM32L552CE, STM32L552ZE, etc.).

TrustZone Memory Partitioning
If using TrustZone, memory can be divided into:
  Secure
  Non-secure
  Non-secure callable areas
This applies to Flash and SRAM regions, which can be configured via SAU (Security Attribution Unit) and GTZC (Global TrustZone Controller).
